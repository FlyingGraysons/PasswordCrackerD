# PasswordCrackerD
A password cracker written in D, a work in progress.
To run, you will need the dmd compiler.
Find it by googling D lang. You can also find documentation about D, a rip off of C.

If you wanna help, learn D. Then ask for editing privledges.

Also, the file with the .d extension is the code, the file with no extention is the compiled version. Not sure if it'll work but whatever.
